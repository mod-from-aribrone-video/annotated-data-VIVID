Annotated data of VIVID for moving object detection from airborne videos 
========================================================================


We annotated all frames of three sequences from VIVID[1] mannually. For each frame, all objects were labeld. The annotated data are availble under this repository now. 




In the text, the annoteted data is organized like:


the number of total frames

frame index  the number of objects in this frame

x1 y1 x2 y2 

.... 



(x1,y1) is the left-top point of the object, while (x2,y2) is the right-below point.
